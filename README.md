# Hidden Markov Model

This is an implementation of the machine learning problem using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). To find the model lambda = (A,B,pi) that best fits the data. 

There are three main files. *HMM.py* is a class-based code that includes the Vebriti algorithm for finding the most likely state sequence given the data. *HMM_verbose.py* is the same code with a different exposition; this is written with obvious and verbose naming conventions outside of a class object. *HMM_testing.py* is the class structure but it's use is to experiment with. 

The folder *papers* includes some nice academic writing about HMM where I tested models and learned from.
